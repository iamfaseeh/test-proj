# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# user1 = User.create!(email: "sufi@gmail.com", name: "sufi", phone: "123456789", password: "123456789", type: "Customer")
# customer1 = Customer.create!(name: "customer1", email: "abu.sufyan@devsinc.com", phone: "1234567890")
product1 = Product.create!(upc: 222, title: "Jeans", description: "this jeans is branded", price: 123)
